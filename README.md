## xd
`xd` is tiny command line program written in Go that generates dmenu based on provided easily configurable yaml files.


### Install
```shell
sudo make install
```
### Uninstall
```shell
sudo make uninstall
```
### Usage
```shell
xd -config=/path/to/config.yaml -command=system -- -l 10 more dmenu args...
```

### Configuration
The xd utility uses configuration files to define the commands it can run.
If the `-config` flag is not provided when running xd,
it will look for configuration files in the directory specified by `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/xd/`.
If this directory does not contain any configuration files, xd will automatically create a default one.

Importantly, xd supports multiple configuration files.
When loading its configuration,
xd will read all the `.yaml` files located in the `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/xd/` directory
and merge the commands defined in them.
This allows you to split your commands across multiple files for better organization, if desired.

Here's an example of a configuration file with detailed explanation:
```yaml
# A top-level command
- name: Mpv               # The name of the command that will be displayed on the dmenu
  prompt: "Paste URL... [Ctrl+Shift+Y] " # The prompt that will be displayed when this command is selected
  cmd: mpv $selected      # The actual command to run. '$selected' will be replaced by the user's input

# Another top-level command
- name: WiFi
  list: "nmcli device wifi list | sed '1d'" # The 'list' command generates dynamic options for the dmenu
  cmd: "device=$(echo $selected | tr -s ' ' | cut -d ' ' -f1); nmcli device wifi connect $device" 
  # The actual command to run. '$selected' will be replaced by the user's selection from the options generated by 'list'

# A top-level command containing sub-commands
- name: System
  commands:              # A list of sub-commands nested under 'System'
    - name: Reboot       # The name of the sub-command that will be displayed on the dmenu
      cmd: reboot        # The actual command to run when this sub-command is selected
    - name: Shutdown
      cmd: shutdown now
    - name: Suspend
      cmd: systemctl suspend

```

### Pass Args to Dmenu

You can pass additional arguments to dmenu after specifying the `-config` or `-command` flags.
It is crucial to add `--` after your flags to indicate the end of command options
and ensure subsequent arguments are passed to dmenu correctly.

For example, to pass the `-l` argument (which controls the number of lines dmenu displays) to dmenu, you would write:
```shell
xd -config=/path/to/config.yaml -- -l 15
```
